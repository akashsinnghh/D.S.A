What is Linked List ?

A linked list is a collection of nodes in non-contiguous memory locations where every node contains some data and a pointer to the next node of the same data type. In other words, the node stores the address of the next node in the sequence. A singly linked list allows traversal of data only in one way.

Following are the terms used in Linked Lists :
  ● Node:A node in a singly linked list contains two fields ○ Datafield which stores the data at the node ○ A pointerthat contains the address of the next node in the sequence. 
  ● Head:The first node in a linked list is called the head. The head is always used as a reference to traverse the list. 
  ● Tail: The last node in a linked list is called the tail. It always contains a pointer to NULL (since the next node is NULL), denoting the end of a linked list.
